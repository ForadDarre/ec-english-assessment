Technical assessment for EC English by Aleksandr Mozhaev

To run the Frontend, please install the packages using yarn ("yarn install");
To run the Backend - simply run it :)

If you have a MS SQL server installed, you can create a DB and populate it with some initial test data. I've created a separate endpoint for this purpose (/api/system/seed).

The second part of the assessemnt was written in "Pseudocode" - as you suggested. I can implement it later if needed.

I didn't have a lot of time to work on the task, so I will create a separate branch for the further enhancements. The main code will remain unchanged and will be in the develop branch.
